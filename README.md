A Minecraft 1.12+ mod designed to create an early game survival concept for
[Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct).

## Overview

Early game is pretty much non-existent in Minecraft. Punch a tree, craft a few items, done! This mod creates a very early game (first few nights) progression that leads directly into Tinkers' Construct tool making. If Constructs' Armory is installed (1.12.2 only), a progression into armor making as well!

### Major Features

 * Vanilla and vanilla-like tools and weapons don't work for players, but are usable by NPCs and craftable for recipes.
 * All tool progression is based around Tinkers' Construct tools and weapons.
 * The only way to make wood planks is with a saw.
   * Saw is a new item introduced that has a "Crude" version and an advanced Tinkers' version.
 * A proper harvest tool must be used. Works correctly, and configurable!
 * Crude tools are necessary to create items needed for crafting Tinkers' tools.
 * Should not conflict with major mods
 * Modpack friendly

#### Gameplay Features
 * Gameplay
   * A correct tool must be used given the block type. Failure is an option.
     * Incorrect tool will make harvesting really slow.
   * All tools and weapons in non-whitelisted mods are rendered ineffective.
   * If enabled, all non-whitelisted armor mods and items are disabled.
   * Planks and sticks are no longer craftable without a tool component. See Crude Saw/Saw.
 * Special Drops
   * Sticks from leaves. (Better drop rate when using a knife)
   * Rocks from rock piles. (No tool required)
   * Plant fiber from grass. (Only if using a knife)
   * Flint shards from whacking rocks on stone.
 * WorldGen
   * Adds rock piles throughout the world. (Generation rate configurable)
